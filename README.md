# Pong Game



## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and the Tkinter GUI framework. 
The game features two paddles and a ball, and players can control the paddles to bounce the ball back and forth.

## Features

- Two-player mode: Control paddles using the keyboard.
- Basic collision detection: Ball bounces off paddles and walls.
- Scoring system: Keeps track of player scores.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## Controls
Player 1 (Left Paddle):
Move Up: W
Move Down: S
Player 2 (Right Paddle):

Move Up: O
Move Down: L

## Game Rules
- Each player controls a paddle on either side of the screen.
- The ball starts in the middle and moves towards one of the paddles.
- Players must move their paddles to bounce the ball back towards the opponent.
- If the ball passes a paddle and hits the edge of the screen, the opposing player scores a point.
- The game continues indefinitely, allowing players to play until they decide to stop.
